# Homework Assignment: Rewards Calculation Application

This project is a simple Spring Boot application written in Java 8 that calculates reward points for customer transactions. The application demonstrates several Java 8 features (like Lambda Expressions, Streams, and the new Date/Time API) and uses Spring Boot for building RESTful services. In addition, it includes tests (both conventional and parameterized) to ensure the logic works correctly.

## Overview

This application simulates a scenario where customer transactions are processed to determine reward points. Reward points are calculated using the following simple rule:

- For every dollar spent over \$50, you earn points.
- Additional bonus points are calculated for dollars spent above \$100.

The objective is to show how to use Java 8 features to process lists of transactions, calculate rewards, and expose the logic via a REST endpoint.

## Project Structure

Below is a brief explanation of the main files and their roles:

- **`HomeworkAssignmentApplication.java`**  
  This is the main class to start the Spring Boot application. It contains the `main` method which boots up the Spring context.

- **`TransactionService.java`**  
  Contains business logic to:
  - Retrieve transactions for a customer within a specified date range.
  - Calculate monthly rewards using Java 8 streams and collectors.

- **`Transaction.java`**  
  A simple Plain Old Java Object (POJO) that represents a single transaction, including details like transaction ID, customer ID, amount, and date.

- **`RewardResponse.java`**  
  A data class used as a response model that includes the customer ID, a list of monthly rewards, and the total reward points.

- **`RewardController.java`**  
  A REST controller that exposes an endpoint (`/api/rewards`) for clients to request reward calculations using customer ID, start date, and end date as parameters.

- **`RewardCalculator.java`**  
  Contains the static method to compute reward points based on a given transaction amount. The calculation logic is split into lower-tier and higher-tier components for numbers between \$50–\$100 and beyond \$100 respectively.

- **`MonthlyReward.java`**  
  A simple class representing the reward for a given month. It stores the month (as a `String`) and the points earned.

- **Test Classes**:  
  - **`HomeworkAssignmentApplicationTests.java`** ensures that the Spring Application context loads properly and that essential beans (like `TransactionService`) are correctly injected.
  - **`RewardCalculatorTest.java`** contains unit tests written with JUnit 5, including both standard and parameterized tests, to check the correctness of the reward calculation logic.

## Key Components

### 1. **Java 8 Features**
- **Lambda Expressions and Streams:**  
  Used in `TransactionService.java` to filter and group transactions. These features enable concise and readable code when processing collections.

- **Date/Time API:**  
  Classes such as `LocalDate` and `YearMonth` are used to manage dates and group transactions by month.

### 2. **Asynchronous Processing**
- The method `getTransactions` in `TransactionService.java` uses the `@Async` annotation from Spring. This allows the method to run on a separate thread without blocking the main application thread. The asynchronous work is wrapped with `CompletableFuture.completedFuture(…)` after processing.

### 3. **Testing Strategies**
- **Conventional Unit Tests:**  
  Individual tests check specific boundary cases in the reward logic.
- **Parameterized Tests:**  
  These tests allow multiple scenarios to be tested in a single method. They demonstrate a deeper range of test cases without writing repetitive code.

## How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites
- **Java 8:**  
  Ensure that Java 8 is installed on your machine.  
- **Maven or Gradle:**  
  This project uses Maven or Gradle for dependency management and build configuration. Make sure one of these tools is installed and properly configured.
- **Spring Boot Dependencies:**  
  All necessary Spring Boot dependencies are listed in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.

### Building the Project
1. **Using Maven:**  
   Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
2. **Using Gradle:**  
   Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run:
   ```bash
   gradle build
   ```

### Running the Application
After a successful build, you can run the application using the following command:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Or if you have a Gradle setup:
```bash
gradle bootRun
```
The application will start and listen on the default port (usually 8080). You can access the rewards endpoint at:
```
http://localhost:8080/api/rewards
```

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following commands:

- **With Maven:**
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```
- **With Gradle:**
  ```bash
  gradle test
  ```
The tests cover:
- **Context Loading:** Ensuring that Spring Boot initializes correctly.
- **Reward Calculation Logic:** Using both conventional tests and parameterized tests to cover various scenarios including edge cases and negative inputs.

## Design and Performance Considerations

### Performance
- **Stream Efficiency:**  
  The code uses Java 8 streams to process lists, which is efficient for collections of moderate size. For very large data sets, consider optimizing by pre-grouping or caching results.
  
- **Asynchronous Execution:**  
  The use of `@Async` ensures that fetching transactions does not block other operations in your application.

### Readability and Maintainability
- **Clean Code:**  
  The logic is split into smaller, well-named methods and classes. For example, the reward calculation logic in `RewardCalculator.java` is divided into clear steps.
  
- **Testing:**  
  Extensive unit tests help catch edge cases and ensure that the logic does not break as the code evolves.

## Final Notes

This project is designed to be a robust example for understanding:
- How to use Java 8 features (streams, lambda expressions, date/time API).
- How to build and run a Spring Boot application.
- How to write and organize tests using JUnit 5, including parameterized tests.

The code is modular, efficient, and well-tested, making it suitable for submission as a homework assignment or as a base for further development.
